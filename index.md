### Welcome to Github Pages of [cgroll](https://github.com/cgroll), research assistant at LMU Munich.

This page lists some links to research and research related things
that I have published somewhere on the web. 

## My blog

You can find my blog hosted on wordpress
[here](https://www.grollchristian.wordpress.com).

## My IJulia notebooks

My IJulia notebooks are collected in the [ijuliaNb
repository](https://github.com/cgroll/ijuliaNb) and can be viewed at
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/cgroll/ijuliaNb/tree/master/).

## Software

Most of the financial econometrics software that I am contributing to
can be found at [JuliaFinMetriX](http://juliafinmetrix.github.io/) 

## My Docker images

My current development environment as well as a stable version of my
packages and notebooks can be accessed as virtual machine through
[docker](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/juliafinmetrix/jfinm_stable/).

This allows interactive exploration of all JuliaFinMetriX notebooks
with the simple command:

````
docker run -p 8888:8888 juliafinmetrix/jfinm_stable
````
