"A tool is but the extension of a man's hand, and a machine is but a
complex tool. He that invents a machine augments the power of a man
and the well-being of mankind." - Henry Ward Beecher

Tools, machines, services: there are some many things out there that
have the potential to make our lives easier and happier. But finding
the best tools among the millions of options can be a difficult and
time-consuming process in itself. Hence, I personally find it pretty
useful to hear about the tools and services that other successful
people use. Similarly, I thought it might be helpful for some people
to share my experiences as well, even though I'm not successful ;-)

## "Second brain" tools

With increasing age and decreasing brain capacity processing the
constant stream of information that we encounter on a daily basis is
not an easy task. Hence, I rely on a series of tools in order to
steadily take notes, connect the dots between snippets of information
and manage my daily life and tasks. Following are the most important
tools in order to build such a second brain.

### Notion

[Notion.so](https://www.notion.so) is a productivity and organization tool that allows users to
create notes, tasks, wikis, and databases all in one place. It is
often referred to as a "second brain" because it allows users to
centralize and access all of their important information and tasks in
one location. Notion's flexibility and customization options allow
users to tailor it to their specific needs and workflows, making it an
effective tool for staying organized and on top of tasks and projects.

### Instapaper

[Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com) is a tool for saving and organizing web pages to a personal
library for later viewing, reading or studying. It minimize
distractions while reading by providing a customized appearance
adjusting the font size, line spacing, and background color.
Additionally, it has a feature called "highlight and notes" that
allows users to highlight specific parts of the article and add notes
to them. These notes can be sync'ed with Notion.so (with the help of
Readwise).

### Readwise

[Readwise](https://readwise.io/) is a tool that helps users to review and retain the
information they've read. It works by integrating with popular reading
apps like Kindle, Instapaper, and Pocket, and automatically extracting
highlights, notes and annotations that users have made in those apps.
It then presents those notes in a daily email digest, and allows users
to review the information at a scheduled time. By doing so, it helps
users to keep track of what they've read, remember the key points, and
retain the information for longer. However, I mostly use Readwise for
it's ability to sync any notes with Notion.so which is my preferred
tool to stay organized and make the most of the information I've
read by making it easily accessible and reviewable.

### Google cloud services

I generally rely on the set of free cloud-based services from Google.
Gmail is my preferred email service. And Google Keep and Google
Calendar are perfect and lightweight tools for note-taking and
scheduling appointments and reminders, in particular whenever I'm on
the go.

## Computer

I like being flexible, that's why I only work on a laptop: my Lenovo Legion 5 with AMD Ryzen 7 6800H processor.

Most important:
- 15,6" high-resolution display
- GeForce RTX 3070

Good price-quality ratio. But only 16GB RAM and only 1TB disk space.

### Operation system

I actually prefer [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/desktop). But graphics card does not work. So I need [Microsoft Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows?r=1) as well.

Ubuntu, Windows
