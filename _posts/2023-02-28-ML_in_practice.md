Below you can find a link to a video of a presentation that I gave at
[KIT Founders
Club](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kit-founders-club/?trk=similar-pages)
about my experiences with ML / AI models in practice.

<br>

It is a rather high-level talk about ML for an audience with mixed
backgrounds. First part is setting some context on the level of
complexity that ML models need to achieve in order to be useful.
Second part shows how ML models can be gradually built from
fine-tuning models on multiple datasets. Third part mentions some of
the technical and infrastructural complexities that one faces when
models are put into a production environment.
