Given that my blog post on [Künstliche Intelligenz mit Plan: So gelingt die Umsetzung im Unternehmen](https://quantitative-thinking.com/2025/03/AI-strategy/) is rather lengthy and available only in German, I have utilized NotebookLM to transform the content into three English-language podcasts. These podcasts hopefully offer a convenient and accessible way to explore the insights of the original blog post. Additionally, the AI occasionally enriched the content with valuable context, examples, and metaphors that actually enhance the understanding of the topic. However, please note that there were also some rare instances of hallucinations that I do not fully endorse.
