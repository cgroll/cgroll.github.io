The 2018 version of the [Atlas of Sustainable Development
Goals](http://datatopics.worldbank.org/sdgatlas/) has been published
by the World Bank Group. As usual, it contains numerous interesting
socio-economic statistics and visualizations, measuring the progress
achieved towards 17 Sustainable Development Goals that are targeted
by 2030. Besides its highly informative charts, the Atlas also sets
high standards in terms of transparency: basically all data is
publicly available, and even visualizations come with a link to the
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) source code hosted on
[github](https://github.com/) (e.g. follow [this
link](https://github.com/worldbank/sdgatlas2018/blob/master/sdg10.R#L360-L385)
to the source code of the first chart below).

From the extensive full collection of charts let me showcase five
examples that I found particularly revealing. The first two charts
address the still ridiculously high transaction costs that are
associated with simple financial transactions in some developing
countries. A simple transfer of money can still be associated with
more than 10% (!) transaction costs. This might not be one of the most
pressing issues that society faces, but it is something that I do
particularly relate to as member of the FinTech industry. Seeing these
kinds of inefficiencies in traditional financial institutions is one
of the main motivations that led me to join the revolution of
financial services. There is still so much that we can gain from
further automation and usage of technology and data, basically in all
business areas of the financial sector: money transfers and payments,
investment management, lending and borrowing, retail banking and many
more.

A second topic that I found disturbing is the fact that Internet usage
is still at only 12% of people in low income countries. Access to
Internet is one of the basic requirements for further advances in
almost every field.

Besides the more technology driven topics from above the Atlas of
Sustainable Development of course also gives a merciless resume of all
of the most pressing problems of our time. For example, even though we
get to hear about armed conflicts regularly in the news, it is always
stunning to realize how many conflicts actually exist in the world:

However, even with such disappointing charts we should not forget the
progress that has been made. One particularly impressive example for
this is the rise in life expectancy in almost all parts of the world
(Africa sadly seems to lack behind).
