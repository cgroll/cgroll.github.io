The 2018 version of the [Atlas of Sustainable Development
Goals](http://datatopics.worldbank.org/sdgatlas/) has been published
by the World Bank Group. As usual, it contains numerous interesting
socio-economic statistics and visualizations, measuring the progress
achieved towards 17 Sustainable Development Goals that are targeted
by 2030. Besides its highly informative charts, the Atlas also sets
high standards in terms of transparency: basically all data is
publicly available, and even visualizations come with a link to the
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) source code hosted on
[github](https://github.com/) (e.g. follow [this
link](https://github.com/worldbank/sdgatlas2018/blob/master/sdg10.R#L360-L385)
to the source code of the first chart below).

From the extensive full collection of charts, let me showcase five
examples that I found particularly revealing. The first two charts
address the still ridiculously high transaction costs that are
associated with simple financial transactions in some developing
countries. A simple transfer of money can still be associated with
more than 10% (!) transaction costs.

A second topic that I found disturbing is the fact that Internet usage
is still at only 12% of people in low income countries.

Besides 
maybe unsurprising (we get to hear about this in the news quite
frequently), numerous armed conflicts in the world.

With all the disappointing statistics we should not forget that we are
making progress (but not fast enough). One particularly impressive
example for this is the rise in life expectancy in almost all parts of
the world. Only Africa is still not good.
