I recently stumbled upon an advertisement of BlackRock's [Advantage
Series](https://www.blackrock.com/de/finanzberater-und-banken/fonds-im-fokus/advantage-serie?siteEntryPassthrough=true&cid=ba:linkedin:sponcon:adv&locale=de_DE&userType=intermediaries)
(the link is to the German webpage that I was directed to, as I could
not find a 100% matching English webpage. There is an [English product
page](https://www.blackrock.com/investing/investment-ideas/advantage),
however, where you can download an Advantage Series guide after
login). 

<br>

According to the German webpage, the Advantage Series is combining
"technology, big data analysis and responsible investing" in the form
of a systematic investment approach. The idea behind the investment
approach is to infer profound and timely insights into financial
markets and individual companies through the use of new and innovative
data sources that go beyond traditional financial data. Some examples
mentioned on the webpage are:

<br>

- thousands of investor blog posts that could reveal
  insights into current and future perspectives of individual
  companies
- comprehensive weather data including data on changes of atmosphere
  and oceans in order to better predict the impacts of droughts,
  hurricanes and other extreme events
- product and employer reviews in social media channels that reveal
  insights into the attractiveness of companies and products
- booking data that shows trends in traveling and helps to forecast
  future revenues

<br>

And as additional icing on the cake, even social and ecological
footprints of companies are taken into account, where controversial
weapon companies or any companies that violate the principles of the
UN Global Compact are excluded.

<br>

Sounds pretty much like the future of investing has already arrived,
right? Well, I definitely support a data driven and systematic
investment approach. Let me nevertheless give a word of caution
though. New sources of data may very well imply that we have more
information at our disposal. But it is not about how much information
we collect, but about the conclusions that we draw from it. In my
opinion the most important benefit of systematic investing is that it
represents a framework where ideas can objectively be tested and
evaluated detached from human biases. Take, for example, systematic
value investing: you can test whether such a strategy would have
worked over different regions, asset classes and time periods. Only if
a trading strategy is sufficiently tested with empirical data we
should have faith that it will work out-of-sample, too. With such new
and innovative data sources as mentioned in BlackRock's Advantage
Series you basically can be sure that any empirical validation could
only have been done on a very limited time frame. Of course, in the
financial industry we always should pursue new investment ideas and
investigate the usefulness of new sources of data. But I think we also
should be very humble and strict about when to push new concepts from
research to production. At least when we do not explicitly state the
experimental character of such innovative strategies and the risks
that come along. It is real clients' money that we are trading, and
overselling is a dangerous way to go.
