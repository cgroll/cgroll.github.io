excerpt: > #
  The idea of leveraged indices is to increase the exposure to a
  certain index. Hence, a leveraged index should come with higher risks
  but also higher return potential than the original underlying index
  itself. Due to the mathematics of compounding, however, the long run
  index performance of leveraged indices can substantially deviate
  from the target performance multiple.
